Cataracts are the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in the worldwide; the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that the number of people with blindness globally is projected to increase from 43.3 million in 2020 to 61.0 million in 2050.
A surgical procedure to replace the eye lens with an artificial one when the cataract makes the vision cloudy, usually in geriatrics. 
Instrument-tissue interaction detection in cataract surgery video is a fundamental problem for surgical scene understanding.

Paper:
1. Instrument-tissue Interaction Quintuple Detection in Surgery Videos (MICCAI2022)



2. ACT-Net: Anchor-context Action Detection in Surgery Vidoes (MICCAI2023, Oral)



Dataset:
We define instrument-tissue interaction quintuple: [instrument bounding box, tissue bounding box, instrument class, tissue class, action class]. Please contact Yan Hu (huy3@sustech.edu.cn) about the dataset.
1. We collect a Cataract Quintuple Dataset based on phacoemulsification.

2. We also label a Cholecystectomy CholecQ Dataset based on publicly available dataset.
