Retinal image registration plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis, image-guided surgery, monitoring of disease progression, and image fusion. The primary objective of image registration is to spatially align a moving (source) image with a fixed (target) image by determining a geometric transformation that accurately matches the corresponding features or structures between the two images. In the realm of ophthalmology, retinal image registration has become an indispensable tool, facilitating precise tracking of temporal changes in retinal anatomy and the alignment of different imaging modalities, which is crucial for evaluating disease evolution and treatment outcomes.

We propose a new dataset for retinal image registration named Coph100 here. We will public the dataset after the paper is accept:
figshare<https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27061084>
Our dataset is constructed based on the ROP classification dataset proposed by Timkovic et al. (Timkoviƒç, Juraj, et al. "Retinal Image Dataset of Infants and Retinopathy of Prematurity." Scientific Data 11.1 (2024): 814.)
Following the readme, you can obtain the registration dataset.
